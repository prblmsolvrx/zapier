This Prisma schema defines a set of related models for a Zap-like automation platform. Here's a breakdown of the relationships and structure:

### Models and Relationships

1. **User**:
   - `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key.
   - `name`, `email`, `password`: Basic user information.
   - `zaps`: One-to-many relationship with the `Zap` model.

2. **Zap**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `triggerId`, `userId`: Foreign keys to the `Trigger` and `User` models, respectively.
   - `trigger`: An optional one-to-one relationship with the `Trigger` model.
   - `actions`: A one-to-many relationship with the `Action` model.
   - `zapRuns`: A one-to-many relationship with the `ZapRun` model.
   - `user`: A many-to-one relationship with the `User` model.

3. **Trigger**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `zapId`: A unique foreign key to the `Zap` model.
   - `triggerId`: A foreign key to the `AvailableTrigger` model.
   - `metadata`: JSON metadata with a default empty object.
   - `type`: A many-to-one relationship with the `AvailableTrigger` model.
   - `zap`: A one-to-one relationship with the `Zap` model.

4. **Action**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `zapId`: A foreign key to the `Zap` model.
   - `actionId`: A foreign key to the `AvailableAction` model.
   - `metadata`: JSON metadata with a default empty object.
   - `type`: A many-to-one relationship with the `AvailableAction` model.
   - `sortingOrder`: An integer with a default value of 0, used for ordering actions.

5. **AvailableAction**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `name`, `image`: Action details.
   - `actions`: A one-to-many relationship with the `Action` model.

6. **AvailableTrigger**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `name`, `image`: Trigger details.
   - `triggers`: A one-to-many relationship with the `Trigger` model.

7. **ZapRun**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `zapId`: A foreign key to the `Zap` model.
   - `metadata`: JSON metadata.
   - `zap`: A many-to-one relationship with the `Zap` model.
   - `zapRunOutbox`: An optional one-to-one relationship with the `ZapRunOutbox` model.

8. **ZapRunOutbox**:
   - `id`: A primary key using a UUID.
   - `zapRunId`: A unique foreign key to the `ZapRun` model.
   - `zapRun`: A one-to-one relationship with the `ZapRun` model.

### Relationships Summary

- **User** ↔ **Zap**: One-to-many.
- **Zap** ↔ **Trigger**: One-to-one (optional).
- **Zap** ↔ **Action**: One-to-many.
- **Zap** ↔ **ZapRun**: One-to-many.
- **Trigger** ↔ **AvailableTrigger**: Many-to-one.
- **Action** ↔ **AvailableAction**: Many-to-one.
- **ZapRun** ↔ **ZapRunOutbox**: One-to-one (optional).

This schema is well-structured for a system that involves automating tasks (Zaps) based on user-defined triggers and actions, with the ability to track execution history (ZapRun).
